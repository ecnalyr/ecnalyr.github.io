title: Understand What You Want
---

It is not uncommon for a client to request a feature without having to ask many questions immediately following the request to clarify scope.  It is possible for clients to interpret this as the developer trying to get out of having to build exactly what they want, the developer pushing their ideas onto the client, or the developer introducing complexity to what is a simple request.  These mis-understandings come from somewhere it is easy to complain about them and wish them away, but we still have to deal with them.

The root of the cause seems to be buried deep in the differences of client experiences with other people they interface with regularly and the expectations of a programmer focused in on efficiently completing a job so they can continue to unashamedly earn their (often perceived as 'high') hourly rates.

Both parties have good intentions, but both parties need to know what the wants in order to move forward.  Just as importantly, in order to convey your intentions to the other party, you need to truly *understand* what you want.

### Just copy this!

A project I'm working on has a 

![duckduckgo pizza locations](/public/duckduckgo_pizza.png "DuckDuckGo Pizza Locations")

* Complete Jekyll setup included (layouts, config, [404](/404), [RSS feed](/atom.xml), posts, and [example page](/about))
* Mobile friendly design and development
* Easily scalable text and component sizing with `rem` units in the CSS
* Support for a wide gamut of HTML elements
* Related posts (time-based, because Jekyll) below each post
* Syntax highlighting, courtesy Pygments (the Python-based code snippet highlighter)

### Hyde features

In addition to the features of Poole, Hyde adds the following:

* Sidebar includes support for textual modules and a dynamically generated navigation with active link support
* Two orientations for content and sidebar, default (left sidebar) and [reverse](https://github.com/poole/lanyon#reverse-layout) (right sidebar), available via `<body>` classes
* [Eight optional color schemes](https://github.com/poole/hyde#themes), available via `<body>` classes

[Head to the readme](https://github.com/poole/hyde#readme) to learn more.

### Browser support

Hyde is by preference a forward-thinking project. In addition to the latest versions of Chrome, Safari (mobile and desktop), and Firefox, it is only compatible with Internet Explorer 9 and above.

### Download

Hyde is developed on and hosted with GitHub. Head to the <a href="https://github.com/poole/hyde">GitHub repository</a> for downloads, bug reports, and features requests.

Thanks!
